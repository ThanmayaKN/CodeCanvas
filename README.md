# CodeCanvas

CodeCanvas is a project that aims to replicate the functionality of the popular code editor platform, CodePen. It allows users to write and execute HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code directly in their web browsers. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only, with no external libraries or frameworks.

## Features

- **Code Execution:** Users can write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in separate panels and see the results instantly in the output panel.
- **Autosave:** The application automatically saves the user's code locally, so they can return to their work even if they close the browser or refresh the page.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/codecanvas.git
   ```

2. Open the project directory:

   ```
   cd codecanvas
   ```

3. Run the application by opening the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

## Usage

1. Open the CodeCanvas application in your web browser.

2. Write your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in their respective panels.

3. Preview the output in the output panel. The output will update automatically as you type.

4. Use the provided toolbar or keyboard shortcuts to perform actions like saving, resetting the code, or toggling full screen mode.
